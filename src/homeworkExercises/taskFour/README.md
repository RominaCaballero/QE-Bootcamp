## The task
Each team must:

Create an "Animal" interface that includes at least the following method signatures: getSpecie(), getBreed(), getName(), and getBirthYear(). Implement at least two classes that implement this interface.

Create the Zoo and ZooArea classes. The Zoo class should have a name and multiple ZooAreas (you can use either an ArrayList or a HashSet for implementation). Additionally, the ZooArea class should have an attribute indicating its animal capacity (the maximum number of animals it can hold), which should be set in the constructor.

Implement a main method to test the creation of the zoo, its areas, and animals. Ensure that an area does not allow adding more animals than its capacity. Use a Stream to filter all areas that contain more than a certain number of animals, printing each animalâ€™s name, species, breed, and age.

Creative freedom is allowed, so the methods, classes, and interface names do not need to match exactly, as long as the general idea is respected (e.g., you can filter by different criteria or perform another operation using streams).
